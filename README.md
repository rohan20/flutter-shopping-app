## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view the online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

### Stateful & Stateless Widgets

In the runApp method inside main.dart, you can replace <b>StatefulShoppingListPage</b> with <b>ShoppingListPage</b> if you do not want the sort grid items functionality.
